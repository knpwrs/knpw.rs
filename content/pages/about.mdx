I am a software engineer living and working in Massachusetts. I work extensively in
Universal JavaScript and HTML5 and have experience in many other technologies.

I also enjoy music, have been known to play drums and bass guitar, and enjoy
solving Rubik's cubes of all sizes! Feel free to take a look around and contact
