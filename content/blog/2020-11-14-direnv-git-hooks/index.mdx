The recent release of [npm@7 broke husky][npm], my git hook management tool of
choice. When I was looking into why my git hooks had stopped working I came
across [the docs for the next version of husky][docs] and saw that git hooks
will now be stored in a committed directory rather than inside `package.json`.
This got me thinking; do I really need husky? Surely there must be a simple
method to manage a directory of git hooks inside your repository. I want
something that's (mostly) automatic, safe, easy, and preferably uses tooling
I'm already familiar with (installing a global dependency just to manage git
hooks on a per-project basis is somewhat less than ideal).

## TL;DR

As the title suggests, I am now using [`direnv`] to manage my git hooks. What I
landed on was adding the following line to a `.envrc` file in the root of my
repositories:

```sh
git config --local core.hooksPath $PWD/.githooks
```

Now I just run `direnv allow` and place whatever hooks I want in the
`.githooks` directory at the root of my project, e.g., an executable file at
`.githooks/commit-msg`.

Check out [knpwrs/instant.bible][ib] or [knpwrs/listenator][kl] on Github to
see this setup in action.

## How does this work?

[I already use `direnv` for other things.][blog] It's a really handy tool for
managing environment variables in a way that isn't tied to any specific
framework or implementation, and additionally makes environment modifications
available to all of your tooling. The trick is that `.envrc` is more than just
a file which specifies variables for [`direnv`] to export -- it's a shell
script which [`direnv`] executes inside of `bash` (even if you use another
shell such as `zsh`). Our `git config` call configures the current git
repository to look for hooks inside the `.githooks` directory inside our
repository. Whereas most solutions involve symlinking or copying files into
`.git/hooks`, we just reconfigure each individual git repository to tell it
where to look for hooks.

[`direnv`] works automatically, so that makes this setup easy to use. It also
won't execute any `.envrc` files without explicit permission, so it's safe.
Since [`direnv`] isn't tied to any specific framework or implementation, this
setup for git hooks works great for polyglot monorepos (e.g., several
microservices in a single git repository or multiple app implementations in a
single repository).

What I really would have liked is some sort of environment variable to
configure where `git` should look for hooks. This works just as well, though.

Note that passing `--local` isn't actually necessary, as `git config` is
`--local` by default, and `--global` only if specified. That said, for this
purpose I do like passing `--local` so our intentions are explicitly clear to
anyone reading our code.

## I want it to be less automated!

I hear you. Running non-exports in your `.envrc` isn't for everyone. If you
would prefer manual hook initialization for your project, or if you would just
like hooks to be opt-in, you can place the `git config` call above into a shell
script or even a `Makefile` like such:

```
.PHONY: hooks

hooks:
	git config --local core.hooksPath $(shell pwd)/.githooks
```

Now just have people run `make hooks` and you're good to go!

## Conclusion

[`direnv`] just may now be my favorite way to manage git hooks now! It's simple,
safe, framework-agnostic, and automatic. I haven't seen the `git config`
approach discussed much elsewhere, so even if you prefer something more manual,
hopefully this article was still helpful to you.
